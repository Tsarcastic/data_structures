- Yall should really clean up the repo, put src files in src and remove empty files (graph.py)
    Done

- The edges method doesn't work because edges is also an attribute.
    Edges method is now edge_report

- This isn't supposed to be a weighted graph.
    Right, but the weight is automatically assumed to be one. To the user it is an unweighted graph.

- If the nodes passed to add_edge are not already present in the graph, they should be added.
    Done.

- neighbors should raise an error if val is not in the graph.

- Since this a directed graph, g.neighbors('a') should only return the nodes it points to not the nodes that point to it. I think adjacent should be the same, but eh, that one's vague.
    Done

- adjacent should raise an error if either of the supplied values are not in the graph.
    Done

- Can you think of some tweaks / a different implementation where every method other than del_node is O(1)?
    Yes, but this was a group assignment and working well with others has been stressed. This is the method we could easily agree upon and didn't bog us down in arguments.

- Are IndexErrors the appropriate errors?
    Fixed
